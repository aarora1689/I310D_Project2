The purpose of this project was to analyze the metrics that Perspective API uses to determine the toxicity of a comment. The attribute of the comment chosen for analysis was length, with a hypothesis that the longer a comemnt is, the more likely to be toxic it is. The results of testing showed the opposite to be true: shorter comments tended to be more toxic.
